He wants to know the main types of *customer personas*. Once he knows these, he will contemplate ways to better market to each persona, better satisfy each persona, better cater to each persona, increase the loyalty of each persona, etc. But first, he must know the personas.\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to help Uncle Steve. Using sneaky magic (and the help of Environics), you've collected four useful features for a subset of the customers: age, income, spending score (i.e., a score based on how much they’ve spent at the store in total), and savings (i.e., how much money they have in their bank account).\n",

        "1. Pick a clustering algorithm (the [`sklearn.cluster`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster) module has many good choices, including [`KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans), [`DBSCAN`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html#sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN), and [`AgglomerativeClustering`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering) (aka Hierarchical)). (Note that another popular implementation of the hierarchical algorithm can be found in SciPy's [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).) Don't spend a lot of time thinking about which algorithm to choose - just pick one. Cluster the customers as best as you can, within reason. That is, try different feature preprocessing steps, hyperparameter values, and/or distance metrics. You don't need to try every posssible combination, but try a few at least. Measure how good each  model configuration is by calculating an internal validation metric (e.g., [`calinski_harabasz_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabasz_score.html) or [`silhouette_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html#sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score)).\n",
        "2. You have some doubts - you're not sure if the algorithm you chose in part 1 is the best algorithm for this dataset/problem. Neither is Uncle Steve. So, choose a different algorithm (any!) and do it all again.\n",
        "3. Which clustering algorithm is \"better\" in this case? Think about charateristics of the algorithm like quality of results, ease of use, speed, interpretability, etc. Choose a \"winner\" and justify to Uncle Steve.\n",
        "4. Interpret the clusters of the winning model. That is, describe, in words, a *persona* that accurately depicts each cluster. Use statistics (e.g., cluster means/distributions), examples (e.g., exemplar instances from each cluster), and/or visualizations (e.g., relative importance plots, snakeplots) to get started. Human judgement and creativity will be necessary. This is where it all comes together. Be descriptive and *help Uncle Steve understand his customers better*. Please!\n",

        "\n",
        "- Since clustering is an unsupervised ML technique, you don't need to split the data into training/validation/test or anything like that. Phew!\n",
        "- On the flip side, since clustering is unsupervised, you will never know the \"true\" clusters, and so you will never know if a given algorithm is \"correct.\" There really is no notion of \"correctness\" - only \"usefullness.\"\n",
        "- Many online clustering tutorials (including some from Uncle Steve) create flashy visualizations of the clusters by plotting the instances on a 2-D graph and coloring each point by the cluster ID. This is really nice and all, but it can only work if your dataset only has exactly two features - no more, no less. This dataset has more than two features, so you cannot use this technique. (But that's OK - you don't need to use this technique.)\n",
        "- Must you use all four features in the clustering? Not necessarily, no. But \"throwing away\" quality data, for no reason, is unlikely to improve a model.\n",
        "- Some people have success applying a dimensionality reduction technique (like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)) to the features before clustering. You may do this if you wish, although it may not be as helpful in this case because there are only four features to begin with.\n",
        "- If you apply a transformation (e.g., [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) or [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler)) to the features before clustering, you may have difficulty interpretting the means of the clusters (e.g., what is a mean Age of 0.2234??). There are two options to fix this: first, you can always reverse a transformation with the `inverse_transform` method. Second, you can just use the original dataset (i.e., before any preprocessing) during the interpreation step.\n",
        "- You cannot change the distance metric for K-Means. (This is for theoretical reasons: K-Means only works/makes sense with Euclidean distance.)\n"

The store sells all the normal food staples (e.g., bread, milk, cheese, eggs, more cheese, fruits, vegatables, meat, fish, waffles, ice cream, pasta, cereals, drinks), personal care products (e.g., toothpaste, shampoo, hair goo), medicine, and cakes. There's even a little section with flowers and greeting cards! Normal people shop here, and buy normal things in the normal way.\n",

You have applied an association rules learning algorithm (like Apriori) to the data, and the algorithm has generated a large set of association rules of the form `{X} -> {Y}`, where `{X}` and `{Y}` are item-sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now comes a thought experiment. For each of the following scenarios, state what one of the discovered association rules might be that would meet the stated condition. (Just make up the rule, using your human experience and intuition.) Also, describe whether and why each rule would be considered interesting or uninteresting for Uncle Steve (i.e., is this insight new to him? Would he be able to use it somehow?).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "> Answer: The rule `{milk} -> {bread}` would have high support, since milk and bread are household staples and a high percentage of transactions would include both `{milk}` and `{bread}`. Uncle Steve would likely not find this rule interesting, because these items are so common, he would have surely already noticed that so many transactions contain them.\n",

I assume you are familiar with what happens inside of normal grocery stores. We are not using actual data and you do not need to create/generate/find any data. I repeat: there is no data for this question.\n",
        "- The reason this question is having you do a thought experiment, rather than writing and running code to find actual association rules on an actual dataset, is because writing code to find association rules is actually pretty easy. But using your brain to come up with rules that meet certain criteria, on the other hand, is a true test of whether you understand how the algorithm works, what support and confidence mean, and the applicability of rules. The question uses the grocery store context because most, if not all, students should be familiar from personal experience.\n",

        "\n",
        "0. Split the data in training and testing. Don't touch the testing data again, for any reason, until step 5. We are pretending that the testing data is \"future, unseen data that our model won't see until production.\" I'm serious, don't touch it. I'm watching you!\n",
        "1. Build a baseline model - no feature engineering, no feature selection, no hyperparameter tuning (just use the default settings), nothing fancy. (You may need to do some basic feature transformations, e.g., encoding of categorical features, or dropping of features you do not think will help or do not want to deal with yet.) Measure the performance using K-fold cross validation (recommended: [`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html#sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score)) on the training data. Use at least 5 folds, but more are better. Choose a [`scoring` parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter) (i.e., classification metric) that you feel is appropriate for this task. Don't use accuracy. Print the mean score of your model.\n",
        "2. Add a bit of feature engineering. The [`sklearn.preprocessing`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing) module contains many useful transformations. Engineer at least three new features. They don't need to be especially ground-breaking or complicated. Dimensionality reduction techniques like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) are fair game but not required. (If you do use dimensionality reduction techniques, it would only count as \"one\" new feature for the purposes of this assignment, even though I realize that PCA creates many new \"features\" (i.e., principal components).) Re-train your baseline model. Measure performance. Compare to step 1.\n",
        "3. Add feature selection. The [`sklearn.feature_selection`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection) has some algorithms for you to choose from. After selecting features, re-train your model, measure performance, and compare to step 2.\n",
        "4. Add hyperparameter tuning. Make reasonable choices and try to find the best (or at least, better) hyperparameters for your estimator and/or transformers. It's probably a good idea to stop using `cross_val_score` at this point and start using [`sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) as it is specifically built for this purpose and is more convienient to use. Measure performance and compare to step 3.\n",
        "5. Finally, using your findings from the previous steps, estimate how well your model will work in production. Use the testing data (our \"future, unseen data\") from step 0. Transform the data as appropriate (easy if you've built a pipeline, a little more difficult if not), use the model from step 4 to get predictions, and measure the performance. How well did we do?\n",

        "- There is no minimum accuracy/precision/recall for this question. I.e., your mark will not be based on how good your model is. Rather, you mark will be based on good your process is.\n",
        "- Watch out for data leakage and overfitting. In particular, be sure to `fit()` any estimators and transformers (collectively, *objects*) only to the training data, and then use the objects' `transform()` methods on both the training and testing data. [Data School](https://www.youtube.com/c/dataschool/featured) has a [helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2XsZdwbCCs) about this. [Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y6O9nCo0-I) are very helpful here and make your code shorter and more robust (at the expense of making it harder to understand), and I recommend using them, but they are not required for this assignment.\n",

        "Uncle Steve has invested in wind. He's built a BIG wind farm with a total of  700 turbines. He's been running the farm for a couple of years now and things are going well. He sells the power generated by the farm to the Kingston government and makes a tidy profit. And, of course, he has been gathering data about the turbines' operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "One area of concern, however, is the cost of maintenece. While the turbines are fairly robust, it seems like one breaks/fails every couple of days. When a turbine fails, it usually costs around \\$20,000 to repair it. Yikes!\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, Uncle Steve is not doing any preventative maintenance. He just waits until a turbine fails, and then he fixes it. But Uncle Steve has recently learned that if he services a turbine *before* it fails, it will only cost around $2,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, there is a potential to save a lot of money here. But first, Uncle Steve would need to figure out *which* turbines are about to fail. Uncle Steve being Uncle Steve, he wants to use ML to build a predictive maintenance model. The model will alert Uncle Steve to potential turbine failures before they happen, giving Uncle Steve a chance to perform an inspection on the turbine and then fix the turbine before it fails. Uncle Steve plans to run the model every morning. For all the turbines that the model predicts will fail, Uncle Steve will order an inspection (which cost a flat \\$500, no matter if the turbine was in good health or not; the \\$500 would not be part of the $2,000 service cost). For the rest of the turbines, Uncle Steve will do nothing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uncle Steve has used the last few year's worth of operation data to build and assess a model to predict which turbines will fail on any given day. (The data includes useful features like sensor readings, power output, weather, and many more, but those are not important for now.) In fact, he didn't stop there: he built and assessed two models. One model uses using deep learning (in this case, RNNs), and the other uses random forests.\n",
        "\n",
        "He's tuned the bejeebers out of each model and is comfortable that he has found the best-performing version of each. Both models seem really good: both have accuracy scores > 99%. The RNN has better recall, but Uncle Steve is convinced that the random forest model will be better for him since it has better precision. Just to be sure, he has hired you to double check his calculations.\n",
